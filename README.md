# Getting started
Autonomous Vehicles Simulator uses artificial neural network as computational model imitating intelligent vehicle moves. Simulator is an desktop application that was implemented with a C++, SFML and Box2D library. Application allows user to create road model, artificial neural network structure and vehicle model that are later used in a process of optimizing neural network using genetic algorithm. Agent interacts with environment through the vehicle detecting road edges. Except from optimizing neural networks, application allows user to test different vehicle models using different neural networks on the same road which may help in determaning the best agent. Below you can find a short list of instructions of how to set up this project locally.

## Prerequisites
Visual Studio 2019 (Desktop development with C++ workload is required)

## Build
Autonomous Vehicles Simulator project can be easily built locally. If you already have Visual Studio 2019 installed all you have to do is clone the repository and its submodules then open Visual Studio project file. You should be able to compile project based on x64 architecture in Debug and Release mode. Project uses SFML and Box2D libraries that are already present in the repository which means that no further actions are required.
